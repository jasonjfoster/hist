Description: Simple and efficient access to Yahoo Finance's historical data API (`/v8/finance/chart/{symbol}`) for querying and retrieval of financial data. The core functionality of the `yfhist` package abstracts the complexities of interacting with Yahoo Finance APIs, such as session management, crumb and cookie handling, query construction, date validation, and interval management. This abstraction allows users to focus on retrieving data rather than managing API details. Use cases include historical data across a range of security types including equities & ETFs, indices, and other tickers. The package supports flexible query capabilities, including customizable date ranges, multiple time intervals, and automatic data validation. It automatically manages interval-specific limitations, such as lookback periods for intraday data and maximum date ranges for minute-level intervals. The implementation leverages standard HTTP libraries to handle API interactions efficiently and provides support for both R and Python to ensure accessibility for a broad audience.
